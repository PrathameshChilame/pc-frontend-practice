      Cricket is a game of patience, strategy, and excitement, where a single
      moment can change the entire match. The sound of the bat hitting the ball,
      the cheer of the crowd, and the tension during the final overs create an
      unforgettable atmosphere. From long test matches that test endurance to
      fast-paced T20 games full of boundaries and wickets, cricket captures the
      hearts of millions. It brings people together across cultures, turning
      players into heroes and matches into memories that last a lifetime.
