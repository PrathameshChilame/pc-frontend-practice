      Football is one of the most popular sports in the world, loved by millions
      for its excitement, teamwork, and passion. Played between two teams of
      eleven players, the main objective is to score goals by getting the ball
      into the opponent’s net using any part of the body except the hands and
      arms. Football promotes physical fitness, strategic thinking, and
      coordination among players. Major tournaments like the FIFA World Cup and
      continental leagues bring countries together and create unforgettable
      moments for fans. Beyond the game itself, football teaches discipline,
      leadership, and the importance of unity, making it more than just a
      sport—it is a global culture.
